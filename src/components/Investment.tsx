            <strong>We help tutoring companies succeed in the age of AI, with a focus on test prep.</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="text-xl text-gray-700 mb-6">
            Our founder Prynce built this company after years of working as a tutor, instructor, and director at tutoring firms. He saw that these businesses needed better tools to grow without getting crushed by technology.
          </p>
          <p className="text-xl text-gray-700 mb-6">
            We create digital worlds so you can have immersive learning environments that seamlessly blend where students study and receive tutoring. This gives your tutoring firm a stronger brand presence and a more cohesive identity in students&apos; lives. No more disconnected tutoring sessionsâ€”students live in your learning world.
          </p>
          <p className="text-xl text-gray-700 mb-6">
            Beyond branding, our system helps manage tutors more efficiently, increases revenue without raising costs, and improves student learning through smart technology that identifies exactly what each student needs help with.
          </p>
          <p className="text-xl text-gray-700 mb-6">
            Students actually enjoy using our system because we&apos;ve made tutoring engaging and social. Tutors love it because they can be more effective with their limited time.
          </p>
          <p className="text-xl text-gray-700 mb-6">
            Our partnership is simple: we invest in your success for a yearly fee plus a share of subscriptions. In return, we help you market your services and scale your business.
          </p>
          <p className="text-2xl text-gray-700 font-semibold">
            Everything we do supports our mission: giving every student a tutor who truly cares about them.
